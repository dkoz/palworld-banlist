# Palworld Banlist API
 Create a Global Ban List API for managing bans across all your Palworld servers. This API will allow you to add, remove, and query bans efficiently.

 This API will be directly tied to [Sphere](https://github.com/projectsphere/sphere) discord bot for Palworld.

## Endpoints
 - `/api/banuser`: Endpoint allowing you to post a ban to the database.
 - `/api/unbanuser`: Endpoint allowing you to remove a ban from the database.
 - `/api/banlist.txt`: Endpoint that will be used in your `PalworldSettings.ini`.
 - `/api/bannedusers`: Endpoint that will output a full list of banned users displaying name, user id, and reason.

## Installation
 Documentation will come at a later date.
